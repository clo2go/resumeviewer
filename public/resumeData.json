    "bio": "I am an accomplished educator with a full stack web developer expertise and a passion for creating and lifelong learning. I thoroughly enjoy the problem solving process while tinkering with and making and breaking apps across the entire stack spectrum. I tend to gravitate towards front end development but love being kept on my toes with backend data challenges and solutions. Ultimately, I’m just addicted to the excitement and magic of making functional, useful, and engaging apps for the web. My strengths lie where my education background and web development experiences intersect. My familiarity with teaching and learning new languages and cultures makes me comfortable adapting to varied teams’ needs and environments. Combine that with my bootcamp experience at UT Austin, which absolutely required fast paced technical proficiency growth for success, and I feel well positioned, technically and mentally, to grow with any demands and industry.",
